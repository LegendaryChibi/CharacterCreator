# CharacterCreator
 
## Summary

This is a basic D&D based character creator made in C++ with Visual Studio. Characters made in this project can be used as placeholders in live D&D to track experience gain, combos, level, descriptions, weapons, etc.

## Basic System

Character creation can be done by inheriting the base CharacterType and adding extra member values such like type of weapons used per class. Characters can be modified and levelled up once certain an experience threshold is met (Default set to 100 XP).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to convey understanding of object oriented principles in C++. As a game programmer, a good grasp of C++ classes and class structure is essential to beginning to understand C++ which is why I made this project.
